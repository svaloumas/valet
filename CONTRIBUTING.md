# Contributing to Valet
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Workflow
We use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), so all code changes happen through Pull Requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Commits
For our commit messages, we tend to adhere to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/svaloumas/valet/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

## License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
